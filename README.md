# Fake-News-Classification-System
This project is about Fake News Classification problem. Implemented traditional ML models with TFIDF & BOW vectorization using 20800 textual data to classify the news category. Furthermore, a deep learning approach has been used with different RNN architectures (LSTM) with a pretrained text embedding layer, Glove Embedding method for binary text classification.
